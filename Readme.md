# Esri/Google Maps Integration using Leaflet Plugins #

A prototype to verify that Esri feature and dynamic layers can integrate with Google Basemaps (Street & Imagery) using Leaflet plug-ins ([Esri Leaflet](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet) & [shramov's leaflet plugins](https://github.com/shramov/leaflet-plugins)).

## Background ##
This was developed as part of a scoping exercise to updat the [MetroInfo Map](http://www.metroinfo.co.nz/map/) to use Google Basemaps instead of OpenStreet Map. Initial development was done using leaflet in preparation for a request such as this.

##Limitations##
This has been developed as a protype only and should only be used for reference only.
